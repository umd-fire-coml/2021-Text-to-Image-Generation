```
conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml
conda acivate text-to-image-generation-env
``` 
into the console to activate the yaml file with all the required libraries.
# Directory Guide


# Training Data
To train your own data, first encode the text that captions your image dataset. To encode your own text use [this](https://github.com/elvisyjlin/skip-thoughts) github that provides a translated to Python 3 version of the skip-thoughtstext encoder.

The text and images of the birds dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ai4x3CQDdI8Jb2teCDjzh6VAU_nXtxrv?usp=sharing)
